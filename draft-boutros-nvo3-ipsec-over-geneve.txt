                    IPsec over Geneve Encapsulation
                draft-boutros-nvo3-ipsec-over-geneve-01

Abstract

   This document specifies how Generic Network Virtualization
   Encapsulation (Geneve) can be used to carry IP Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) and IP Authentication Header (AH) to provide secure
   transport over IP networks.  Using IPSec ESP the Geneve payload is
   encrypted and integrity protected, and using IPSec AH the Geneve
   headers and payload are integrity protected.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) develop solutions for
   network virtualization within a data center (DC) environment that
   assumes an IP-based underlay.  An NVO3 solution provides layer 2 and/
   or layer 3 overlay services for virtual networks enabling multi-
   tenancy and workload mobility.  The Generic Network Virtualization
   Encapsulation [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] have been recently recommended
   to be the proposed standard for network virtualization overlay
   encapsulation.

   Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) does not have
   any inherent security mechanisms.  An attacker with access to the
   underlay network transporting the IP packets has the ability to snoop
   or inject packets.

   Within a particular security domain, such as a data center operated
   by a single provider, the most common and highest performing security
   mechanism is isolation of trusted components.  Tunnel traffic can be
   carried over a separate VLAN and filtered at any untrusted
   boundaries.  In addition, tunnel endpoints should only be operated in
   environments controlled by the service provider, such as the
   hypervisor itself rather than within a customer VM.

   When crossing an untrusted link, such as the public Internet, IPsec
   [RFC4301] may be used to provide authentication and/or encryption of
   the IP packets formed as part of Geneve encapsulation.  If the remote
   tunnel endpoint is not completely trusted, for example it resides on
   a customer premises, then it may also be necessary to sanitize any
   tunnel metadata to prevent tenant-hopping attacks.

Internet-Draft           NVO3 IPsec over Geneve                July 2017


   This document describes how Geneve tunnel encapsulation
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve] can be used to carry both the IP Encapsulation
   security payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and the IP authentication header
   (AH) [RFC4302] to provide secure transport over IP networks.  Using
   IPsec ESP and AH will provide both Geneve header integrity protection
   and Geneve payload encryption.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) over Geneve tunnel

   The Geneve packet is encapsulated in UDP over either IPv4 or IPv6.
   The Geneve packet consists of a Geneve header which is then followed
   by a set of variable options.  The Geneve header protocol type will
   indicate that the Geneve payload is the ESP protocol (IP Protocol
   50), and the Geneve payload will consist of the ESP protocol data.
   The ESP next header can carry only an IP protocol so can't carry the
   inner Ethernet frame, so given that (1) Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE) [RFC2784] and EtherIP [RFC3378] are IP protocols and (2) GRE/
   EtherIP can carry Ethernet Frames, hence the need of EtherIP/GRE
   encapsulation for the inner Ethernet payload.

   The ESP Next Header field will be set to inner payload protocol which
   can be either EtherIP (97) or to the Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE) (47).  The GRE protocol type will be set to the Ethernet
   protocol type.  IPsec transport mode encryption is used.

   Inner Ethernet packet, as sent/received by the virtual machine:

   +----------+---------+
   | Ethernet | Ethernet|
   | header   | Payload |

   After applying Geneve and ESP, with ETH-IP header:

  +-----+------+------+----------+------+---+-------+------+-------+---+

4.  IP Authentication header (AH) over Geneve tunnel

   The Geneve packet is encapsulated in UDP over either IPv4 or IPv6.
   The Geneve packet consists of a Geneve header which is then followed
   by a set of variable options.  The Geneve header protocol type will
   indicate that the Geneve payload is the AH protocol (IP Protocol 51),
   and the Geneve payload will consist of the Authentication header
   (AH).  The AH next header can carry only an IP protocol so can't
   carry the inner Ethernet frame, so given that (1) Generic Routing
   Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784] and EtherIP [RFC3378] are IP protocols
   and (2) GRE/EtherIP can carry Ethernet Frames, hence the need of
   EtherIP/GRE encapsulation for the inner Ethernet payload.

   The AH Next Header field will be set to inner payload protocol which
   can be either EtherIP (97) or to the Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE) (47).  The GRE protocol type will be set to the Ethernet
   protocol type.

   It is to be noted that some of the option TLV(s) in the Geneve header
   SHOULD be treated as mutable fields and not included in the AH
   authentication.

   +----------+---------+
   | Ethernet | Ethernet|
   | header   | Payload |
   +----------+---------+

   After applying Geneve and AH, with ETH-IP header:

   +--------+------+------+----------+------+---+-------+------+
   |Ethernet|outer |UDP   |Geneve Hdr|Geneve|AH |EtherIP|Inner |
   |header  |IP    |port= |Protocol  |Option|   |Header |Ether |
   |        |header|Geneve|=51       |TLV(s)|   |       |packet|
   +--------+------+------+----------+------+---+-------+------+
            |<--- authenticated except for mutable fields ---->|

   +--------+------+------+----------+------+---+-------+------+
   |Ethernet|outer |UDP   |Geneve Hdr|Geneve|AH |GRE    |Inner |

   +--------+------+------+----------+------+---+-------+------+
            |<--- authenticated except for mutable fields ---->|

5.  Control Plane Considerations

   A control plane extension could allow a Network Virtualization
   Endpoint (NVE) to express the next protocol that can be carried by
   Geneve to its peers.

   In the datapath, a transmitting NVE MUST NOT encapsulate a packet
   destined to another NVE with any protocol the receiving NVE is not
   capable of processing.

   In this document the next protocol signaled in control plane by
   NVE(s) can be ESP or AH.

   Once two NVE(s) agree to carry ESP or AH as next protocol, the NVEs
   can use IKEv2 [RFC7296] to negotiate, establish, modify, and delete
   IPsec Security Associations.

6.  Security Considerations

   If network policy requires IPsec encryption for certain traffic, it
   is important to ensure un-encrypted packets are not delivered to the
   guest virtual machine.  This is implemented by dropping packets that
   arrive without the necessary IPsec encryption.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not register anything new with IANA.
