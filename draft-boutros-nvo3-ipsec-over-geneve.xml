   This document specifies how Generic Network Virtualization
   Encapsulation (Geneve) can be used to carry IP Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) and IP Authentication Header (AH) to provide secure
   transport over IP networks. Using IPsec ESP and AH will provide both
   Geneve header integrity protection and Geneve payload encryption.

<section title="Introduction">
   <t>The Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) develop solutions
   for network virtualization within a data center (DC) environment
   that assumes an IP-based underlay. An NVO3 solution provides layer
   2 and/or layer 3 overlay services for virtual networks enabling
   multi- tenancy and workload
   mobility. The <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve">Generic Network
   Virtualization Encapsulation</xref> have been recently recommended
   to be the proposed standard for network virtualization overlay
   encapsulation.</t>

   <t>Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) does not have
   any inherent security mechanisms. An attacker with access to the
   underlay network transporting the IP packets has the ability to snoop
   or inject packets.</t>

   <t>Within a particular security domain, such as a data center operated
   by a single provider, the most common and highest performing security
   mechanism is isolation of trusted components.  Tunnel traffic can be
   carried over a separate VLAN and filtered at any untrusted
   boundaries. In addition, tunnel endpoints should only be operated in
   environments controlled by the service provider, such as the
   hypervisor itself rather than within a customer VM.</t>

   <t>When crossing an untrusted link, such as the public Internet,
   <xref target="RFC4301">IPsec</xref> may be used to provide
   authentication and/or encryption of the IP packets formed as part
   of Geneve encapsulation.  If the remote tunnel endpoint is not
   completely trusted, for example it resides on a customer premises,
   then it may also be necessary to sanitize any tunnel metadata to
   prevent tenant-hopping attacks.</t>

   <t>This document describes
   how <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve">Geneve tunnel
   encapsulation</xref> can be used to carry both the IP Encapsulation
   security payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"/> and the IP
   authentication header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"/> to provide
   secure transport over IP networks. Using IPsec ESP and AH will
   provide both Geneve header integrity protection and Geneve payload
   encryption.</t>

<section title="Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) over Geneve tunnel">

   <t>The Geneve packet is encapsulated in UDP over either IPv4 or
   IPv6.  The Geneve packet consists of a Geneve header which is then
   followed by a set of variable options. The Geneve header protocol
   type will indicate that the Geneve payload is the ESP protocol (IP
   Protocol 50), and the Geneve payload will consist of the ESP
   protocol data.  The ESP next header can carry only an IP protocol
   so can't carry the inner Ethernet frame, so given that
   (1) <xref target="RFC2784">Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE)</xref> and <xref target="RFC3378">EtherIP</xref> are IP
   protocols and (2) GRE/EtherIP can carry Ethernet Frames, hence the
   need of EtherIP/GRE encapsulation for the inner Ethernet
   payload.</t>

   <t>The ESP Next Header field will be set to inner payload protocol
   which can be either EtherIP (97) or to the Generic Routing
   Encapsulation (GRE) (47). The GRE protocol type will be set to the
   Ethernet protocol type. IPsec transport mode encryption is used.</t>

<section title="IP Authentication header (AH) over Geneve tunnel">
   <t>The Geneve packet is encapsulated in UDP over either IPv4 or
   IPv6.  The Geneve packet consists of a Geneve header which is then
   followed by a set of variable options. The Geneve header protocol
   type will indicate that the Geneve payload is the AH protocol (IP
   Protocol 51), and the Geneve payload will consist of the
   Authentication header (AH). The AH next header can carry only an IP

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) <xref target="RFC2784"/> and

   <t>It is to be noted that some of the option TLV(s) in the Geneve

<section title="Control Plane Considerations">
   <t>A control plane extension could allow a Network Virtualization
   Endpoint (NVE) to express the next protocol that can be carried by
   Geneve to its peers.</t>

   <t>In the datapath, a transmitting NVE MUST NOT encapsulate a
   packet destined to another NVE with any protocol the receiving NVE
   is not capable of processing.</t>

   <t>In this document the next protocol signaled in control plane by
   NVE(s) can be ESP or AH.</t>

   <t>Once two NVE(s) agree to carry ESP or AH as next protocol, the
   NVEs can use <xref target="RFC7296">IKEv2</xref> to negotiate,
   establish, modify, and delete IPsec Security Associations.</t>

<section anchor="security_considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>If network policy requires IPsec encryption for certain traffic, it
is important to ensure un-encrypted packets are not delivered to the
guest virtual machine.  This is implemented by dropping packets that
arrive without the necessary IPsec encryption.</t>
